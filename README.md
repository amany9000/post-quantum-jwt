# post-quantum-jwt
A POC for post-quantum JWT generation with the lib [djwt](https://github.com/amany9000/dJWT). The post-quantum digital signature algorithms are generated using [noble-post-quantum](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-post-quantum).

It implements JWT using two algorithms
- DLITHIUM
- SPHINCS

## Installation 

```sh
npm install
```


## How to use üõ†Ô∏è

Genrate Keys
```sh
tsx generateKeys.ts 
```

Create token 
```sh
tsx token.ts
```

---

## JWT Size 
- The smallest size of both algorithms is when `iss = id` with the id (primary key) being mapped to public_key in `keys.json`. This JWT size is 2.5 KB with DLITHIUM and 8KB with SPHINCS.
- id is the 128-bit Blake2s hash of the public_key.
- The implemenration with `iss = public_key` increases the size of the DLITHIUM JWT drastically to 5.1KB while SPHINCS JWT's size is not increased much as the SPHINCS public key is not too large in size: 32bytes.
