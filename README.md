# post-quantum-jwt

A POC for post-quantum JWT generation using [djwt](https://github.com/amany9000/dJWT). The post-quantum digital signature algorithms are generated through [noble-post-quantum](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-post-quantum).

It implements JWT using two algorithms:

- [DILITHIUM](https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/index.shtml)
- [SPHINCS](https://sphincs.org/index.html)

## Installation

```sh
npm install
```

## How to use üõ†Ô∏è

Generate Keys

```sh
tsx generateKeys.ts
```

Create token

```sh
tsx token.ts
```

---

## JWT Size

- The smallest size of both algorithms is when `iss = id` with the id (primary key) being mapped to public_key in `keys.json`. This JWT size is 2.5 KB with DLITHIUM and 8KB with SPHINCS.
- id is the 128-bit Blake2s hash of the public_key.
- The implemenration with `iss = public_key` increases the size of the DLITHIUM JWT drastically to 5.1KB while SPHINCS JWT's size is not increased much as the SPHINCS public key is not too large in size: 32bytes.
- DLITHIUM is the better choice for JWTs because of it's lower signature size and faster speed.
